About Gong Cha: At Gong Cha, they believe in serving quality bubble tea. Their teas can be blended with a variety of fruits, toppings and creative mixes. Gong Cha prides itself on offering fresh tea and toppings to our customerâ€™s everyday. How do we do this? Our tea and tapioca pearls are kept fresh every four hours. Bubble tea is our specialty and we are excited to have our customers enjoy a great cup of tea with Gong Cha. (From Gong Cha Official website). Gong cha is one of my favorite Drink shop in New York, using the data provided and the data I found on Internet, I would like to help Gong Cha make the decision of where to open the next Cong Cha Shop.      
      
In the following analysis. I will make the decision of where to open the next Gong Cha Shops among the new buildings that applied their permit in 2018. I will mainly focus on Manhattan and use the data of DOB permit issuance, data of New York Census, data of Zip_Zri house rental price, data of existing Gong Cha shop, and data of its main competitor Kungfu Tea to facilitate my analysis.
